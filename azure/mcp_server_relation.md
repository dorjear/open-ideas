# Relation Between MCP Server and Implementation Plan

## Implementation Plan Overview
The implementation plan outlines the steps required to embed documents into Azure Cognitive Search and interact with them via API. It includes:
1. Setting up Azure services.
2. Developing scripts for embedding generation, indexing, and querying.
3. Testing and optimizing the workflow.

## MCP Server Role
The MCP server (`azure-vector-server`) is designed to automate and simplify the implementation plan by providing tools that encapsulate the required functionality:
1. **Generate Embeddings**:
   - The `generate_embeddings` tool in the MCP server corresponds to Step 2 of the implementation plan.
   - It uses Azure OpenAI Service to create vector embeddings for documents.

2. **Index Embeddings**:
   - The `index_embeddings` tool corresponds to Step 3 of the implementation plan.
   - It uploads document metadata and embeddings to Azure Cognitive Search.

3. **Query Embeddings**:
   - The `query_embeddings` tool corresponds to Step 4 of the implementation plan.
   - It retrieves documents based on semantic similarity using vector-based queries.

## Benefits of Using MCP Server
- **Centralized Workflow**: The MCP server consolidates all steps into a single interface, reducing the need for separate scripts.
- **Ease of Use**: Tools provided by the server abstract away the complexity of interacting with Azure APIs.
- **Scalability**: The server can be extended to include additional tools or resources as needed.

## Notes
- The MCP server is built to align with the implementation plan, ensuring seamless integration and execution of the outlined steps.
- Users can interact with the server using an MCP client to execute the tools and achieve the goals of the implementation plan.
