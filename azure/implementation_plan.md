# Implementation Plan for Document Embedding and Retrieval

## Step 1: Set Up Azure Services
1. **Azure OpenAI Service**:
   - Create a deployment for the embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).
   - Note the deployment ID and region for API access.

2. **Azure Cognitive Search**:
   - Create a search service.
   - Define an index schema to store document metadata and embeddings.

## Step 2: Develop Scripts
1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Write a script to send document content to the Azure OpenAI Service API.
   - Parse the response to extract embedding vectors.

2. **Indexing Documents**:
   - Write a script to upload document metadata and embeddings to Azure Cognitive Search using the REST API.

3. **Querying Documents**:
   - Write a script to send vector-based queries to Azure Cognitive Search.
   - Parse the response to retrieve relevant documents.

## Step 3: Test the Workflow
1. Use sample documents to test embedding generation, indexing, and querying.
2. Validate the accuracy and performance of the vector-based search.

## Step 4: Optimize for Production
1. Implement batch processing for large datasets.
2. Secure API keys and sensitive data.
3. Monitor and scale Azure services as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in all scripts.
- Use environment variables to manage API keys and configuration details.
