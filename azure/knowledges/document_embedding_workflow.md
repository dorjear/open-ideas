# Workflow for Embedding Documents into Azure Cognitive Search

## Step 1: Generate Embeddings
Use Azure OpenAI Service to generate embeddings for your documents. This involves:
- Sending the document content to the Azure OpenAI API.
- Receiving the embedding vector as a response.

## Step 2: Store Embeddings in Azure Cognitive Search
- Create an index in Azure Cognitive Search to store the embeddings.
- Use the Azure Cognitive Search REST API to upload the embeddings along with metadata (e.g., document ID, title).

## Step 3: Query the Vector Database
- Use the Azure Cognitive Search REST API to perform vector-based queries.
- Provide a query vector (e.g., generated from user input) to retrieve documents based on semantic similarity.

## Required APIs
1. **Azure OpenAI Service API**:
   - Endpoint: `https://<region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/openai/deployments/<deployment-id>/embeddings`
   - Method: POST
   - Authentication: API Key

2. **Azure Cognitive Search REST API**:
   - Endpoint: `https://<search-service-name>.search.windows.net/indexes/<index-name>/docs`
   - Methods:
     - POST (for indexing documents)
     - GET (for querying documents)
   - Authentication: API Key

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up Azure OpenAI Service and Cognitive Search.
2. Write scripts to:
   - Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI Service.
   - Index embeddings into Azure Cognitive Search.
   - Query the vector database for document retrieval.
3. Test the workflow with sample documents.

## Notes
- Ensure proper authentication and API key management.
- Optimize the embedding generation and indexing process for large datasets.
